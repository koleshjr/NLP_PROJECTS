Fake News Classification
Overview

Welcome to the "Fake News Classification" project! In this project, the goal is to build a model capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles. The ability to discern misinformation is crucial in today's digital age, where the spread of fake news can have significant societal impacts.
Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate classification model that can automatically identify whether a given news article is genuine or fake. The model's predictions will be based on features extracted from the text content of the articles.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of news articles labeled as either real or fake. Each article is accompanied by relevant metadata and potentially additional features that can aid in the classification task.
