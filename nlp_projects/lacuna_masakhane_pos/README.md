Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP), as it allows algorithms to understand the grammatical structure and meaning of a text. This is especially important in creating the building blocks for preparing low-resource African languages for NLP tasks. The MaseakhaPOS dataset for 20 typologically diverse African languages, including benchmarks, was created with the help of Lacuna Fund to try and address this problem.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution that correctly classifies 14 parts of speech for the unrelated Luo and Setswana languages. You will need to build one solution that applies to both languages, not two solutions, one for each language.

It is important that only one solution be built for both languages as this is a step in creating a solution that can be applied to many different languages, instead of having to create a model for each language.

This challenge is also important for Lacuna Fund, to help reach their goals of making ML-ready datasets available from low- and middle-income contexts.


The error metric for this competition is Accuracy.
There are 17 parts of speech for both Luo and Setswana.
