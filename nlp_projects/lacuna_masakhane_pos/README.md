## MaseakhaPOS Challenge: Part-of-Speech Tagging for Luo and Setswana
### Overview

Welcome to the MaseakhaPOS Challenge! This project focuses on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically tailored for two unrelated African languages: Luo and Setswana. The objective is to create a unified machine learning solution that accurately classifies 14 parts of speech for both languages. This challenge is a crucial step in preparing low-resource African languages for various NLP tasks.
Dataset

The MaseakhaPOS dataset encompasses 20 typologically diverse African languages, including benchmarks for Luo and Setswana. Created with the support of Lacuna Fund, this dataset aims to address the challenges of limited linguistic resources for African languages in the context of NLP.
### Aim

The primary goal of this challenge is to develop a single machine learning solution capable of accurately classifying 14 parts of speech for both Luo and Setswana. Instead of creating language-specific models, the objective is to build a versatile solution applicable to a range of languages, aligning with the broader goal of making ML-ready datasets available from low- and middle-income contexts.
### Challenge Details

    Target Languages: Luo and Setswana
    Parts of Speech: 17 categories for each language
    Evaluation Metric: Accuracy
    Unified Solution: Build one solution applicable to both languages

### Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries/Frameworks: Transformers
